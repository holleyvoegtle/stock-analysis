# Stock-analysis/Module 2 VBA of All Stocks
## Overview of Project
Steve has asked our expertise to create a worksheet to initially analyze a certain data set of stocks prices over a period of time. This then was expanded to include more data and all stocks. Through the use fo VBA we were able to look at a large data set and make decisions from there.	

### The purpose and background 
The purpose of this challenge was to build upon what we have worked through with the module and to become more familiar with Visual Basics for Applications (VBA). Through the module we built worksheets to analyze stocks for Steve to give to his parents. They hired their son to help them make better financial decisions on the stocks. VBA is used to expand on what Excel cannot do and to start learning how to code. We created and became familiar with things like macros, inputs, for loops, and conditionals. 

This particular challenge was used to collect the information we used thus far through the used of edits or refractoring. This was done to see if the VBA script ran faster and more efficient. It basically taking the code we have already done and building on it for speed. 


## Results
The execution time was faster with the refactored script in comparison to the original as seen in the screen shots included. Not all that sure that I did these correctly but I tried and those are my results. 


## Summary

### The advantages and disadvantages of refactoring code in general:
The advantage of using a refactoring code is that it should be quicker to build upon and add from the code already provided. A disadvantage is that the code could have originally been incorrect or incomplete. This could lead to more time spent looking for the problems instead of writing it from scratch.


### Pros and cons that apply to refactoring of the original VBA script?
The Pros is that we did not have to rewrite the code but follow directions. But the disadvantages are that if we don't have a good grasp on the code already written, we could be doing it incorrectly and not know where we went wrong. I personally am not a fan of this and it is quite obvious I do not have a good grasp on VBA.
